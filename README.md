# optipuzzle
A suite for displaying, solving and creating optimizer puzzles.

Currently just a start with the may optimizer puzzle from: https://puzzles-jn.wixsite.com/puzzles/optimizers
I build with CodeLite IDE and g++ on LINUX. But this repository holds only sources and headers, not any project or makefile.

## Todo:
* Add a code analysis step to secure code quality (coding standards, documentation, ...) from the very beginning.
* For May 2020:
  * Implementation of Grid.IsValid()
  * Implementation of Grid.Points_Get()
  * A real algorithm for finding solutions.
