Rules:

 Given: The following 12x12 grid

 .......x....
 ..x....x....
 .....x......
 ....xx....xx
 ........x...
 xx.....xx...
 ............
 ...xx......x
 .........x..
 .xx...x...x.
 ......x.....
 ....x...x...

 whereas a "." represents an empty field (to be filled by user) and an "x" represents a blocked field.

 Steps to build a solution:

  1) Grid is to be filled with a complete set of pentominos (they are F, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z). They are allowed to be rotated and reflected. But they must not touch each other, not even diagonally.

  Each field in any pentomino gets automatically a number from 1 to 5, whereby each number occurs only once per pentomino ascending from first left to right and second top to bottom. (We call it in "western world reading order".)
  Since the grid contains 120 empty fields at start and the pentominos will fill 60 fields, there remain 60 empty fields.

  2) They are all to be filled manually with the numbers 1 to 5, each of them occuring exactly 12 times. (So in the end the complete grid is filled by 24 numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 each. 12 of them within pentominos, 12 outside.)

 Calculation of points:

  a) If a number in a field is different from all numbers in adjacent fields (8 adjacent fields): Value of field = Sum of numbers in field and adjacent fields.
  b) If a number in a field touches at least one field with the same number: Value of field = (-1) * Number in field * Sum of numbers in adjacent fields.
  c) Value of solution = Sum of value of each field.

 Find a solution with as much points as possible!
